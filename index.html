        <h2>Web Security Defined</h2>
        <p>Web security refers to protecting networks and computer systems from damage to or the theft of software, hardware, or data. It includes protecting 
            computer systems from misdirecting or disrupting the services they are designed to provide.</p>
            <p>Web security is synonymous with cybersecurity and also covers website security, which involves protecting websites from attacks. It includes cloud 
                security and web application security, which defend cloud services and web-based applications, respectively. Protection of a virtual private 
                network (VPN) also falls under the web security umbrella.</p>
                <p>Web security is crucial to the smooth operation of any business that uses computers. If a website is hacked or hackers are able to manipulate your 
                    systems or software, your website—and even your entire network—can be brought down, halting business operations.</p>

                    <h2>Technologies for Web Security</h2>

                <p>Various technologies are available to help companies achieve web security, including web application firewalls (WAFs), security or vulnerability 
                    scanners, password-cracking tools, fuzzing tools, black box testing tools, and white box testing tools.</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Web Application Firewalls(WAFs)</li>
                    <li>Security or Vulnerability Scanners</li>
                    <li>Password-cracking Tools</li>
                    <li>Fuzzing Tools</li>
                    <li>Black Box Testing Tools</li>
                    <li>White Box Testing Tools</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Display of Properties of your Computer</h2>

                <p>There are properties to illustrate the breadth of information about a user’s computer that a web app can access; 
                    height of display screen(not including taskbar), width of display screen (not including taskbar),
                display screen's bit depth if a color palette is in use, display screen's color resolution in bits per pixel, and height and width of display screen.
            When you open this webpage in a browser, it displays all the information of your computer, explained above</p>

                <h2>Best Practices for Safe Web Browsing</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>Pay Attention to the Site You Visit - Not all websites are safe. A website’s URL with an SSL certificate begins with https, not http, 
                        like https://www.youtube.com/. It also has the padlock icon before the URL. </li>
                    <li>Keep the Browser Updated - Hackers often seek web browsers’ vulnerabilities to attack the users. By keeping your browser updated, your 
                        device can get the latest security version and prevent hackers from attacking it.</li>
                    <li>Be Careful About Hyperlinks and Ads - It’s essential to check whether the URL links lead to the correct domain. One way to do this is 
                        by hovering over the text link and seeing the preview at the bottom corner of your browser. </li>
                    <li>Use a Secure Internet Connection - To prevent cyberattacks, try to avoid using public Wi-Fi and use your mobile data instead.</li>
                    <li>Use VPN for Safe Web Browsing - Virtual Proxy Networks (VPN) can help maintain users’ privacy because it encrypts your data before sending 
                        you to a website. As a result, the website, internet providers, and advertisers can’t track your internet activities. </li>
                    <li>Install Antivirus Software - Antivirus software helps protect your device because it offers various security features, like firewall, 
                        spyware and identity protection, and VPN.</li>
                    <li>Block Pop-Ups - Browser pop-ups can appear when you open a website. They can be dangerous for your browsing experience because they may 
                        contain ads, harmful links, and inappropriate content. </li>
                    <li>Clean Web Browser Cookies and Cache - Go to the settings and look for a tool for clearing browser history. Some browsers also give you 
                        an option to clear the cache automatically.</li>
                    <li>Use Two-Factor Authentication - Two-factor authentication provides additional security to the sign-in process. It connects your browser 
                        usage and the physical location you usually log in from. </li>
                    <li>Turn On Private Browsing - Private browsing or incognito mode can help keep your internet activity private from other people that use 
                        the same device. </li>
                    <li>Create Strong Passwords - Make passwords unique, longer and memorable and avoid using personal info.</li>
                    <li>Bookmark Important Websites - It gives you quick access to a page and helps prevent typos when typing the URL.</li>
                </ul>
